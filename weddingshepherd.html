            <h1>Wedding Shepherd</h1>
            <p>You join and register your guests, straight from your phone contact list. They'll get a message saying they've been added to your wedding party.</p>
            <p>You register all of your events, the information needed (e.g. specific times, addresses, dress code, and whatever else you need). Your guests will get a message early in the morning warning them about the day's events, so they'll be there in time, dressed appropriately.</p>
            <h2>You'll avoid...</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>tons of messages on your busiest day of the decade asking where the reception is (even after telling the guests 1000 times...)</li>
                <li>or your friend's clueless new boyfriend showing up in red to an all-blue party and ruining the pictures</li>
                <li>your sister-in-law, who's a bridesmaid, getting there two hours after the photo shooting started</li>
                <li>grandma missing the most amazing toast because she "thought it was as 3pm"</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Priority Level: High</h2>
            <h3>Ease to make: 4/5</h3>
                <p>Not so hard to make, probably course-level, and no need for great user interface</p>
            <h3>Ease to grow: 3/5</h3>
                <p>Not sure. Might be scallable via wedding planners & wedding website maker, and wedding fairs.</p>
            <h3>Ease to monetize: 5/5</h3>
                <p>Weddings are super expensive and this will be a tiny expense at R$497. Sounds easy.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, we can monetize with ads, as the audience is super valuable.</p>
            <h3>Fun & Heart: 4/5</h3>
                <p>Might be useful in Renata's wedding! Plus, many friends have weddings coming up.</p>
