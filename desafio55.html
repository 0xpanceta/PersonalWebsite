            <h1>Desafio 5/5</h1>
            <p>You and your friends will challenge yourselves: for 5 weeks, you'll each exercise 5 times a week. Anyone who doesn't has to pay up (and you can spend the money on the group after the 5 weeks are over).</p>
            <p>On the app, you form the group, define your goals, post images of your workouts as proof, and keep track of everyone's scores.</p>
            <h2>Does it work?</h2>
            <p>I know it does. How? It worked for my friends and me. Now, it can work for you too.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Social incentives to actually get fit.</li>
                <li>Fun with your friends and a reason to chat every day.</li>
                <li>Actual accountability.</li>
                <li>A fun weekend together spending the payouts.</li>
            </ul>
