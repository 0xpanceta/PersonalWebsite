            <h1>Remote Team Fun</h1>
            <p>It's easy to disengage from your work when you're fully remote. Especially if part of the team is remote, and part isn't.</p>
            <p>Now, I won't solve your problem 100%, but I can definitely draw your team closer, with a touch of humanity. Here's wat Remote Team Fun does.</p>
            <p>Whenever the birthday of a team member is coming up, we'll send everyone else an email asking for a few happy birthday words. We'll add in a few suggestions and prompts, which will make the message be even more touching.</p>
            <p>When the actual date comes, we'll agther them up in a stylized birthday card and send them, along with the caring words of their friends.</p>
            <p>The best part? As this is all in Beta stage, it's 100% free. Sign your team up today.</p>
            <h2>Could you do it by yourself?</h2>
            <p>Definitely. There are three problems with that approach, though:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It would take man power, which is definitely more expensive than th price I'd charge you (if/when I do).</li>
                <li>Inconsistence: it'd be a bad look if someone was forgotten. The machine never forgets though.</li>
                <li>Would you even do it? Let's face it, this might fall into the end of tasklist after tasklist and never get done.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Priority Level: Medium</h2>
            <h3>Ease to make: 5/5</h3>
                <p>Super easy logic I think</p>
            <h3>Ease to grow: 3/5</h3>
                <p>I can give it away to DCers. But that's limited.</p>
            <h3>Ease to monetize: 1/5</h3>
                <p>Not too valuable a task. I'd have to add features to eventually charge relevant money.</p>
                <p>@5usd per person per year, I'd need 10K people to land 50K/y which isn't a lot of money.</p>
            <h3>Fun & Heart: 3/5</h3>
                <p>Not fun to deal with HR, but fun to deal with small internet companies and entrepreneurs.</p>
